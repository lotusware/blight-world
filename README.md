![BLIGHTWORLD - Currently in Closed Beta - April 2020](https://blight.world/twitch/twitch/video-player-banner.jpg)

*Blightworld is a free-to-play hybrid tabletop-RPG-slash-videogame powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset + OBS set in the world of ERAFLUX, with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects for players.  Sounds complicated, but the framework handles most of the back-end tracking and formulas.*


### PATCHNOTES
##### Feb-17-2020
- **Bonus, Equip, Total now rendered as one item in app** : This is just so it takes less resources and can be maintained easier.
- **Added Knack Indicator** : The mechanic didn't give enough feedback to players on its effects. App handles the math and just shows the resulting rolls, instead of having them do the mental math.


# FOR PLAYERS
### Okay so if you want to play...
Its in closed beta until I can iron things out and will probably be there for a while until I can build a solution that isn't based out of Google Sheets.  
### That being said...
If you're interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player come April I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.  As time allows, I'll be opening up more hosting sessions but for now, I think I am limited to only two a week.

# FOR VIEWERS - What you can do
Even though you're not playing, you can earn dust over time by being in the channel.  Dust in-game has many uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending Dust (streamlab points) or Dust Fragments (channel points).
