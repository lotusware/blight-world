![BLIGHTWORLD - Currently in Closed Beta - April 2020](https://blight.world/twitch/twitch/video-player-banner.jpg)

*Blightworld is a free-to-play hybrid tabletop-RPG-slash-videogame powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset + OBS set in the world of ERAFLUX, with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects for players.  Sounds complicated, but the framework handles most of the back-end tracking and formulas.*


### PATCHNOTES
##### Feb-19-2020
- **`QoL` PEACEKEEPER Application** : Got rid of some redundant questions and better explained a few elements to make it easier to roll a character.
##### Feb-17-2020
- **`Bugfix` Bonus, Equip, Total now rendered as one item in app** : This is just so it takes less resources and can be maintained easier.
- **`QoL` Knack Indicator** : The mechanic didn't give enough feedback to players on its effects. App handles the math and just shows the resulting rolls, instead of having them do the mental math.


# FOR PLAYERS
### Okay so if you want to play...
Feel free to create a character via [Google Form - PEACEKEEPER Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmjwwZHayq47IHvxQiucQkFVtI5mC1rq6w7P7Ju3KLcgfMDg/viewform). 

The game is in closed beta until I can iron things out and will probably be there for a while until I can build a solution that isn't based out of Google Sheets.  You can tweet me @EraFlux, or whisper LOTUSWARE on Twitch so I know who to send the profile to if I don't know who you are.

### That being said...
If you're interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player come April (maybe sooner) I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.  As time allows, I'll be opening up more hosting sessions but for now, I think I am limited to only two a week.

# FOR VIEWERS
Even though you're not playing, you can earn **Dust** over time by watching the game be played by others. 

Dust has many in-game uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending **Dust** (streamlab points) or **Dust Fragments** (channel points).  Although using either **Dust** or **Dust Fragments** can have a profound impact in Blightworld, only Dust shifts the world towards Ire or Calm, and only **Dust Fragments** can be used to create events/items/effects in the game world.

More Ire | More Calm
---------|----------
Enemies are stronger but drop better items | Enemies are weaker and drop fewer items
Inhabitants of the world are more wary of players | Inhabitants are more trusting and friendly towads players
Ire-aligned quests may become available | Calm-aligned quets may become available

Using **Dust Fragments** can have such effects as bringing back bosses or inhabitants as revenants, applying modifications to enemies, and leaving messages in player's data logs, to name a few.


### Channel Commands
- `!Breathe 123`  - Consume an amount of Dust to move the World Dial towards **Ire**
- `!Scatter 123`  - Consume an amount of Dust to move the world Dial towards **Calm**
