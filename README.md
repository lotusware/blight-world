##### CURRENTLY IN CLOSED BETA

## PLAYERS - Getting started
If you're only interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player, [I set up a changelog/patchnotes page](https://blight.world) and come April I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.

## What you I do as a viewer?
Even though you're not playing, you can earn dust over time by being in the channel.  Dust in-game has many uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending Dust.  The options planned out is to *Breathe Dust* which increases difficulty of the game, or *Scatter Dust*--decreasing difficulty.  

WORLD DIAL | Ire 30 | Ire 15 | +/- 15 | Calm 15 | Calm 30

In addition to the scaling difficulty, consuming large amounts of dust will create in-game triggers.  the effect
