![BLIGHTWORLD - Currently in Closed Beta - April 2020](https://blight.world/twitch/twitch/video-player-banner.jpg)

#### Blightworld is a free to play tabletop RPG powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset + OBS set in the world of ERAFLUX, with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects for players.


### PATCHNOTES
##### Feb-17-2020
- Bonus, Equip, Total now rendered as one item in app ` This is just so it takes less resources and can be maintained easier.
- Added Knack Indicator ` The mechanic didn't give enough feedback to players on its effects.  Now, the app handles the math and just shows the resulting rolls, instead of having them do the mental math.



### FOR PLAYERS - Getting started
If you're only interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player come April I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.




### FOR VIEWERS - What you can do
Even though you're not playing, you can earn dust over time by being in the channel.  Dust in-game has many uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending Dust (channel points) or Dust Fragments (streamlabs points).  

The commands are to *Breathe Dust* which increases difficulty and rewards of the game, or *Scatter Dust*--decreasing difficulty and rewards.  

WORLD DIAL | Ire 500 | Ire 250 | +/- 250 | Calm 250 | Calm 500
-----|-----|---------|--------|--------|--------
Enemy level | + 25% | + 10%  |    |  - 10% |  - 25%
Dust awarded | + 50% | + 25% |   | - 25% |  - 50%
First Meetings | -2 Friendship | -1 Friendship | Neutral  |  +1 Friendship |  +2 Friendship



In addition to the scaling difficulty, consuming large amounts of dust will create in-game triggers.  The below can only be triggered by Dust--not Dust Fragments.

DUST | ...Breathe | ...Scatter
-----|---------|--------
Each consumed Dust | Moves scale towards Ire | Moves scale towards Calm
50 | Applies a mod to an enemy | Next enemy drops healing item
1000 | Revive enemy as a vengeful spirit | Revive an ally as a spirit
