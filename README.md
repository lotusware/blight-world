![BLIGHTWORLD - Currently in Closed Beta - April 2020](https://blight.world/twitch/twitch/video-player-banner.jpg)

*Blightworld is a free-to-play hybrid tabletop-RPG-slash-videogame powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset + OBS set in the world of ERAFLUX, with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects for players.  Sounds complicated, but the framework handles most of the back-end tracking and formulas.*


### PATCHNOTES
##### Feb-19-2020
- **`QoL` PEACEKEEPER Application** : Got rid of some redundant questions and better explained a few elements to make it easier to roll a character.
##### Feb-17-2020
- **`Bugfix` Bonus, Equip, Total now rendered as one item in app** : This is just so it takes less resources and can be maintained easier.
- **`QoL` Knack Indicator** : The mechanic didn't give enough feedback to players on its effects. App handles the math and just shows the resulting rolls, instead of having them do the mental math.


# FOR PLAYERS
### Okay so if you want to play...
Feel free to create a character via [Google Form - PEACEKEEPER Application](https://forms.gle/zZK9XtbU6pHeG34L8Its).  The game is in closed beta until I can iron things out and will probably be there for a while until I can build a solution that isn't based out of Google Sheets.  You can tweet me @EraFlux, or whisper LOTUSWARE on Twitch so I know who to send the profile to if I don't know who you are.

### That being said...
If you're interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player come April I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.  As time allows, I'll be opening up more hosting sessions but for now, I think I am limited to only two a week.

# FOR VIEWERS
Even though you're not playing, you can earn dust over time by being in the channel.  Dust in game has many uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending Dust (streamlab points) or Dust Fragments (channel points).  Dust tends to be more powerful, 

### Channel Commands
- `!Breathe 123`  - Consume an amount of Dust to move the World Dial towards **Ire**
- `!Scatter 123`  - Consume an amount of Dust to move the world Dial towards **Calm**
