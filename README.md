![BLIGHTWORLD - Currently in Closed Beta - April 2020](https://blight.world/twitch/twitch/video-player-banner.jpg)

#### Blightworld is a free to play tabletop RPG powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset + OBS set in the world of ERAFLUX, with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects for players.


### PATCHNOTES
##### Feb-17-2020
- Bonus, Equip, Total now rendered as one item in app `This is just so it takes less resources and can be maintained easier.`
- Added Knack Indicator `The mechanic didn't give enough feedback to players on its effects. App handles the math and just shows the resulting rolls, instead of having them do the mental math.`



### FOR PLAYERS - Getting started
If you're only interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player come April I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.




### FOR VIEWERS - What you can do
Even though you're not playing, you can earn dust over time by being in the channel.  Dust in-game has many uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending Dust (streamlab points) or Dust Fragments (channel points).
