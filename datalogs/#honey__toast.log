<@%+LOTUSWARE> 1. Travel south of your farm to the Marnie's Ranch. You can reach there from your farm directly if you can chop through overgrowth in the south. Also, you can go through the Pelican Town and then loop back west.
<@%+LOTUSWARE> 2. Walk south until the point that you hit the water, at that point take after the water south until the point when you discover a bridge that is leading east.
<@%+LOTUSWARE> 3. Cross the bridge to locate a forest. Once you're in the trees, travel east to discover a cliff ledge, and take after the ledge south until the point that you locate the Lost Axe.
