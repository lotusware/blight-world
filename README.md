![BLIGHTWORLD - Currently in Closed Beta - April 2020](https://blight.world/twitch/twitch/video-player-banner.jpg)


### PATCHNOTES
##### Feb-19-2020
- **`QoL` PEACEKEEPER Application** : Got rid of some redundant questions and better explained a few elements to make it easier to roll a character.
##### Feb-17-2020
- **`Bugfix` Bonus, Equip, Total now rendered as one item in app** : This is just so it takes less resources and can be maintained easier.
- **`QoL` Knack Indicator** : The mechanic didn't give enough feedback to players on its effects. App handles the math and just shows the resulting rolls, instead of having them do the mental math.

### About the game
*Blightworld is a free-to-play hybrid tabletop-RPG-slash-videogame powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset + OBS set in the world of ERAFLUX—more on that below—with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects for players.  Sounds complicated, but the framework handles most of the back-end tracking and formulas.*

# A brief history of the World of *ERAFLUX*
#### VOID ERA - Prehistory
- **Otherworlders** create life from the darkness from which vivilizations rise and build out of hte nothingness that existed
- Connection to the power of the **Otherworld** discovered—called **Flux** and after many years, naturally was used to advance technology and weapons
- Galactic War was fought acrsoss the universe. **Otherworlders** intervene—destroying everything.
- In the wake of the conflict, the **Otherworlders** create the **World Seed** which acts as the will of the **Flux** in their stead.
- The next of the civilizations begin to rebuild around the now planet-sized **World Seed**, naming the system **Kaircoran**
#### CATALYST - Year 0
- The **World Seed** choses **The Six**—beings bestowed a great power and knowledge—to guide the universe
- One of **The Six** attempts to usurp the seed but in doing so, **The Six** are pulled across time and space, creating great rifts from which **Flux** pours out
- The **World Seed**, instead of advancing the universe in accordance to the **Otherworlders'** wills, attempts to course correct any effects due to the exploitation of these rifts.
#### ENLIGHTED ERA - Year 850
- Over time, all knowledge of the **Otherworlders, the Six**, and these rifts become legend and myth
- The first of the post-Catalyst studies of **Flux** are conducted by the **Guardians**, who ensured that they would continue to pass their knowledge and skill down the generations
- The first of the rifts were discovered, thanks to the help of a powerful being named **Archos** and through him, the rift was sealaed in an object of his design called an "Atlas"
- **Archos** continued to commit to closing as many rifts as he could find with the help of the Guardians
- Another mysterious being emerges and hunts down **Archos and his Guardians**, corrupting those who desired power
- Eventually, after much conflict, The Guardians are no more aside from those following their new master
#### DAWN ERA - Year 1175
- With the shadows cast over the universe still in peoples' minds, several core systems band together under a unified government
- The **Galactic Autocratic Federacy** is born, ruled over by a leader known as **The Unarch**
- There are still pockets of dangerous systems throughout the universe, and a great unkown waiting to be discovered
- These core planets set up their government on the technologically-rich system of Kaircoran
- After some time, a long-reaching arm of government is created, with a focus on technological research and military force
- This group is called the **PEACEKEEPERS** and they are sent out to deploy outposts on neighbouring systems in an attempt to bring the unruly under the order of the **GAF**
- The furthest of these outposts from the core worlds is on **Ermoor**—set up as an experimental reasearch center and as a way to stake claim in the unknown regions of space
### This is where the story of *Blightworld* begins
Set some years after the outpost on Ermoor has been operating, you along with many others jump at the opportunity to join the PEACEKEEPER ranks, especially at such a great paygrade.  Your mission is yet unknown to you, but still you are haunted by an inescapable dread and plagued by a visions of what's to come...


# For Players
### Okay so if you want to play...
Feel free to create a character via [Google Form - PEACEKEEPER Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmjwwZHayq47IHvxQiucQkFVtI5mC1rq6w7P7Ju3KLcgfMDg/viewform). 

The game is in closed beta until I can iron things out and will probably be there for a while until I can build a solution that isn't based out of Google Sheets.  You can tweet me @EraFlux, or whisper LOTUSWARE on Twitch so I know who to send the profile to if I don't know who you are.

### That being said...
If you're interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player come April (maybe sooner) I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.  As time allows, I'll be opening up more hosting sessions but for now, I think I am limited to only two a week.

# For Viewers
Even though you're not playing, you can earn **Dust** over time by watching the game be played by others. 

Dust has many in-game uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending **Dust** (streamlab points) or **Dust Fragments** (channel points).  Although using either **Dust** or **Dust Fragments** can have a profound impact in Blightworld, only Dust shifts the world towards Ire or Calm, and only **Dust Fragments** can be used to create events/items/effects in the game world.

More Ire | More Calm
---------|----------
Enemies are stronger but drop better items | Enemies are weaker and drop fewer items
Inhabitants of the world are more wary of players | Inhabitants are more trusting and friendly towads players
Ire-aligned quests may become available | Calm-aligned quets may become available

Using **Dust Fragments** can have such effects as bringing back bosses or inhabitants as revenants, applying modifications to enemies, and leaving messages in player's data logs, to name a few.


### Channel Commands
- `!Breathe 123`  - Consume an amount of Dust to move the World Dial towards **Ire**
- `!Scatter 123`  - Consume an amount of Dust to move the world Dial towards **Calm**
