![BLIGHTWORLD - Currently in Closed Beta - April 2020](https://blight.world/twitch/twitch/video-player-banner.jpg)

*Blightworld is a free-to-play hybrid tabletop-RPG-slash-videogame powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset + OBS set in the world of ERAFLUX, with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects for players.  Sounds complicated, but the framework handles most of the back-end tracking and formulas.*


### PATCHNOTES
##### Feb-19-2020
- **`QoL` PEACEKEEPER Application** : Got rid of some redundant questions and better explained a few elements to make it easier to roll a character.
##### Feb-17-2020
- **`Bugfix` Bonus, Equip, Total now rendered as one item in app** : This is just so it takes less resources and can be maintained easier.
- **`QoL` Knack Indicator** : The mechanic didn't give enough feedback to players on its effects. App handles the math and just shows the resulting rolls, instead of having them do the mental math.


# A brief history of the World of *ERAFLUX*
#### VOID ERA - Prehistory
- **Otherworlders** create life from the darkness from which vivilizations rise and build out of hte nothingness that existed
- Connection to the power of the **Otherworld** discovered--called **Flux** and after many years, naturally was used to advance technology and weapons
- Galactic War was fought acrsoss the universe. **Otherworlders** intervene--destroying everything.
- In the wake of the conflict, the **Otherworlders** create the **World Seed** which acts as the will of the **Flux** in their stead.
- The next of the civilizations begin to rebuild around the now planet-sized **World Seed**, naming the system **Kaircoran**
#### CATALYST - Year 0
- The **World Seed** choses **The Six**--beings bestowed a great power and knowledge to guide the universe
- One of **The Six** attempts to usurp the seed--but in doing so, **The Six** are pulled across time and space, creating great rifts from which **Flux** pours out
- The **World Seed**, instead of advancing the universe in accordance to the **Otherworlders'** wills, attempts to course correct any effects due to the exploitation of these rifts.
#### ENLIGHTED ERA - Year 850
- Over time, all knowledge of the **Otherworlders, the Six**, and these rifts become legend and myth
- The first of the post-Catalyst studies of **Flux** are conducted by the **Guardians**, who ensured that they would continue to pass their knowledge and skill down the generations
- The first of the rifts were discovered, thanks to the help of a powerful being named **Archos** and through him, the rift was sealaed in an object of his design called an "Atlas"
- **Archos** continued to commit to closing as many rifts as he could find with the help of the Guardians
- Another mysterious being emerges and hunts down **Archos and his Guardians**, corrupting those who desired power
- Eventually, after much conflict, The Guardians are no more aside from those following their new master
#### DAWN ERA - Year 1175
- With the shadows cast over the universe still in peoples' minds, several core systems band together under a unified government
- The **Galactic Autocratic Federacy** is born, ruled over by a leader known as **The Unarch**
- There are still pockets of dangerous systems throughout the universe, and a great unkown waiting to be discovered
- These core planets set up their government on the technologically-rich system of Kaircoran
- After some time, a long-reaching arm of government is created, with a focus on technological research and military force
- This group is called the **PEACEKEEPERS** and they are sent out to deploy outposts on neighbouring systems in an attempt to bring the unruly under the order of the **GAF**
- The furthest of these outposts from the core worlds is on **Ermoor**--set up as an experimental reasearch center and as a way to stake claim in the unknown regions of space
### This is where the story of *Blightworld* begins
Some years after the outpost on Ermoor has been operating--as you and others are recruited from neighbouring systems jump at the opportunity to join the PEACEKEEPER ranks. Your mission is yet unknown to you, but still you are haunted by an inescapable dread and plagued by a visions of what's to come...


# For Players
### Okay so if you want to play...
Feel free to create a character via [Google Form - PEACEKEEPER Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmjwwZHayq47IHvxQiucQkFVtI5mC1rq6w7P7Ju3KLcgfMDg/viewform). 

The game is in closed beta until I can iron things out and will probably be there for a while until I can build a solution that isn't based out of Google Sheets.  You can tweet me @EraFlux, or whisper LOTUSWARE on Twitch so I know who to send the profile to if I don't know who you are.

### That being said...
If you're interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player come April (maybe sooner) I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.  As time allows, I'll be opening up more hosting sessions but for now, I think I am limited to only two a week.

# For Viewers
Even though you're not playing, you can earn **Dust** over time by watching the game be played by others. 

Dust has many in-game uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending **Dust** (streamlab points) or **Dust Fragments** (channel points).  Although using either **Dust** or **Dust Fragments** can have a profound impact in Blightworld, only Dust shifts the world towards Ire or Calm, and only **Dust Fragments** can be used to create events/items/effects in the game world.

More Ire | More Calm
---------|----------
Enemies are stronger but drop better items | Enemies are weaker and drop fewer items
Inhabitants of the world are more wary of players | Inhabitants are more trusting and friendly towads players
Ire-aligned quests may become available | Calm-aligned quets may become available

Using **Dust Fragments** can have such effects as bringing back bosses or inhabitants as revenants, applying modifications to enemies, and leaving messages in player's data logs, to name a few.


### Channel Commands
- `!Breathe 123`  - Consume an amount of Dust to move the World Dial towards **Ire**
- `!Scatter 123`  - Consume an amount of Dust to move the world Dial towards **Calm**
