# Blightworld
##### CURRENTLY IN CLOSED BETA
A free to play tabletop RPG powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset set in the world of ERAFLUX, with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects.  



### PLAYERS - Getting started
If you're only interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player come April I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.

### What you I do as a viewer?
Even though you're not playing, you can earn dust over time by being in the channel.  Dust in-game has many uses (currency, empowering characters, making choices) but as a viewer, you can influence the game world by spending Dust (channel points) or Dust Fragments (streamlabs points).  

The commands are to *Breathe Dust* which increases difficulty and rewards of the game, or *Scatter Dust*--decreasing difficulty and rewards.  

WORLD DIAL | Ire 500 | Ire 250 | +/- 250 | Calm 250 | Calm 500
-----|-----|---------|--------|--------|--------
Enemy level | + 25% | + 10%  |    |  - 10% |  - 25%
Dust awarded | + 50% | + 25% |   | - 25% |  - 50%
First Meetings | -2 Friendship | -1 Friendship | Neutral  |  +1 Friendship |  +2 Friendship



In addition to the scaling difficulty, consuming large amounts of dust will create in-game triggers.  The below can only be triggered by Dust--not Dust Fragments.

DUST | ...Breathe | ...Scatter
-----|---------|--------
Each consumed Dust | Moves scale towards Ire | Moves scale towards Calm
50 | Applies a mod to an enemy | Next enemy drops healing item
1000 | Revive enemy as a vengeful spirit | Revive an ally as a spirit
