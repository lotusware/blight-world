# Blightworld
A free to play tabletop RPG powered by Google Sheets + Javascriptset set in the world of ERAFLUX, with a companion app that helps with handling more of the complex aspects.  

##### CURRENTLY IN CLOSED BETA

## Getting Started
Feel free to submit an issue or contact me for access when I'm ready for go-live because its still a very manual process to assign out the resources, but working on it!  The below instructions will be for when you already have everything set up.  The rest of this readme isn't written with players themselves in mind because they don't have any setup or installation requirements.  

If you're only interested in seeing how the game is changing for you as a player, [I set up a changelog/patchnotes page](https://blight.world) or come April I'll be [hosting the closed beta sessions on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lotusware) if you want to follow there.

### Prerequisits as "Principal"
In layman's terms--a DM or Dungeon Master.  The Principal is responsible for customizing encounters, moving the story forward, or even flat out designing areas/battles based on the ever-growing pool of resources.

##### You will need...
* a Google Account--for managing the Google Sheet
* if Pen-and-Paper (you are physically hosting a session with your players)

  * secondary screen, or a way to print out maps
* if Play-on-Stream (hosting a session over livetream)
  * Twitch channel or any Streamlabs-compatible service
  * Voice app to host the session and its players
